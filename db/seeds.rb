# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

# Seed users
User.create(first_name: "John", last_name: "Doe", email: "john@example.com", password: "welcome")
User.create(first_name: "Oliver", last_name: "Smith", email: "oliver@example.com", password: "welcome")
